# LightScatteringModels
Python implementation of Lorentz-Drude (LD) model, Mie theory for light scattering and absorption

The LD model computes the dielectric function of bulk metallic gold, which is then used to compute the light scattering and absorption of nanoparticles using Mie theory.

This code was included in my MSc thesis in Nanotechnology, specialization in Nanoelectronics and Photonics, 2020.
